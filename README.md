# Salary Insight Coding Challenge - Deel 

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

This repository houses a test automation project utilizing Cypress and JavaScript to automate the salary insight page on Deel website.

##  Project Structure

This basic project comprises one spec file (SalaryInsight.cy.js), and displays the automated test case (Validating Salary Insight).

The steps for the test case can be found on the commands.js file.

The SelectorLibrary.js file sets all the page elements so they can be easily used and read on the custom commands.
